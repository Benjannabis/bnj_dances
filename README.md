# bnj_dances
 
_Hello! I developed this dancing system similar to the one found in the After Hours DLC. Created from scratch, using NativeUI and native Animations_
 
### How to start 📋
 
_NativeUI is required for this to function_
 
```
start NativeUI
start bnj_dances
```
 
### Keybinds 🔧
 

__F10__ : Open / Close Menu

__SHIFT__ : Change dancing style (Men and women have two different dances each)

__E__ : Increase Intensity

__Q__ : Decrease Intensity

__LEFT AND RIGHT ARROWS__ : Move arms in that direction

__X__ : Stop dancing / animation
